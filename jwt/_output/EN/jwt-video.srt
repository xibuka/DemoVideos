00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,814
In this video, we'll show you how to secure your upstream API use the JWT plugin.

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:16,231
First, let's create a service which is point to an echo upstream API. I'm using a public HTTP Request & Response Service, called httpbin. I

3
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:24,163
set the sub path to /anything so the response will be the same of my request.

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,910
Next, create a route for this service so we can access it from outside. I will set the path to /demo so we can access this API with this

5
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:34,641
path.

6
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:45,525
Let's try to access the httpbin server using Kong Gateway. Send a request to port 8000 of the kong gateway instance, with a subpath /demo

7
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:53,031
which we set in the route. We got a 200 response so our settings looks good.

8
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:01,059
OK, let's enable the JWT Plugin on the service level. In this demo, we will keep all the default settings and click install. Please note

9
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:08,059
the key claim name is ISS , we will use it when creating the token.

10
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:14,736
Let's try to access the API again. We don't have a valid token so get blocked this time.

11
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:22,755
Next, let's start to create a valid JWT token. First, create a consumer called Joe.

12
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:31,918
Second, create a JWT credential for Joe. Leave the key and secret as blank and Kong will generate them for you. JWT plugins can use several

13
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:40,057
algorithms to verify the token's signature. We will use the default HS256 in this demo.

14
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:46,655
The secret is not shown in the GUI due the security reason. We can confirm it from the CLI, the admin API. We will use the key and the

15
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:52,253
secret to create the token.

16
00:01:53,499 --> 00:02:00,138
You can also use your own credentials for the JWT plugin. Just input them in the key and secret field,

17
00:02:03,338 --> 00:02:06,493
and you can also see them via the Admin API.

18
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:19,148
We can create the token in jwt.io. Add a new field called iss in the payload section, with the value of the key. Then input the secret in

19
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:26,637
the verify signature section. You can get the token on the left side of the page.

20
00:02:27,859 --> 00:02:32,747
Let's access the API again with this token. Copy the token and add it in the authorization header as a Bearer token. You should be able to

21
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:37,835
access successfully this time.

22
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:45,364
As a conclusion, using jwt plugin can help you to protech your API very easy. It can help you to verify the JSON Web Token in different

23
00:02:45,564 --> 00:02:51,893
algorithms. Thanks for watching, see you next time.
